#### Ankikarten Sanity Check
- Is an Anki deck up to date with the lecture and suitable for exam studying?
- Compare provided Anki deck with lecture script/slides
- Find and flag possible discrepancies
	- e.g. wrong info, info not found in resources, chapters from resources not covered by Anki cards
- Give overall quality score
- User can review flagged parts and decide whether Anki deck is usable and what needs to be updated/adjusted

#### Interactive Uni-FAQ
- Use RAG to answer questions based on university resources
- Biggest benefit: pooling information from different university divisions/areas
	- Typical problem is segmentation of affairs at university
		- It's hard to know what exists and where to find information/resources you need
	- LLM answers as tool for discovering what services/info exists and where to find what
- Especially interesting for new students, but also practical applications in everyday studies
- Problem: some topics need to be correct for legal and administrative reasons
	- Providing sources/links for fact checking is essential for most questions
- Resources to aggregate and pull information from:
	- List of departments/services/groups/offices/clubs with descriptions
		- Where do I find information on X? Who is responsible for X?
		- Is there a service/group/office dealing with X?
	- Module catalog and course catalog
		- What are lectures in the field of X?
		- I need 3 ECTS in study area X. What are options I have?
		- Are courses X and Y compatible?
		- What was the distribution of grades last semester?
	- Examination regulations
		- Can I take course X in the general studies of my major?
	- Campus map
		- Where is the lecture hall X located?
		- What are the opening hours of X?
	- Mensa
		- What are the vegetarian meal options on Tuesday?
		- Will there be served pasta next week?
	- HSP
		- When is the course on X? Do I need special equipment?
	- Unikino
		- What are the special sneaks this semester?
	- User generated content
		- Forums, Discord servers
- Obviously can't implement everything
- Make system modular and expandable
	- e.g. pick two info sources and focus on how to decide from where to pull info for a question and how to add additional information and topics later
		- Advanced RAG with topic modelling
	- Preparing for long term vision of whole university chatbot as part of the project
- Evaluate topic modelling advantages
	- Compare RAG after topic modelling with RAG using single unsorted document collection
	- Are the generated answer better, when the RAG is performed on topic specific documents compared to a unified document corpus?

#### Lecture Translator Pop Quiz
- Make watching lecture recordings more engaging
- Use lecture transcription to generate quiz questions that pop up at appropriate times
- Accept natural language answer for question
- Check answer against transcript
	- Check answer for correctness and provide corrections or supplement information
	- Always provide link to parts of transcript used to generate question and check the answer
