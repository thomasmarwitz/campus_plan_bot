# What to build

ASR + LLM to achieve something cool / fun. Let the LLM use tools (agent) to realize behaviour (other than just chatting).

Ideas:
- RAG with the "Modulhandbuch"
  - Ilias course registration
  - Calendar management (personal assistant)
- w/ "Lecture Translator"
  - Ask followup questions
  - Generate a quiz for each lecture with references to the transcript for the solution
    - Could be advanced into a universal exam trainer
- Note taking assistant:
  - Record voice note -> transcribe it -> format it (markdown)
  - Addon: from voice note to slides - create your slides while going for a walk or while in the subway
    - same as above
    - structuring / breaking content down into slides (initial draft)
    - creating slides from the content (markdown)
    - in the end, visualization using [https://marp.app/](https://marp.app/)
    - Optional: publicly exposing the slides (or pw protected) for quick sharing / presentation
