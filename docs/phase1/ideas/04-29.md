- We decided on pitching a general purpose bot that classifies incoming requests into topics (1),  uses tools, e.g. RAG, (2) and synthesizes an answer using retrieved the tool's results (3).
- The system will be built expandable in step 1 and 2 (add new topics, add new tools per topic).
- We want to start with 2 topics
- After initial exploration, decide on topics with best available data / best evaluation possible
  - Current favorite: Campusplan and module catalog
